# Optimisation of Disparity Calculation for Real-Time Implementation on a Multicore DSP
University project to research and develop techniques and optimisations for efficient implementation of stereo vision on an inexpensive multi-core digital signal processor.
This implementation used OpenMP and achieved a 416% increase in performance over a naive, unoptimised implementation on a TIC6678, capable of achieving a consistent 25 frames/second.
